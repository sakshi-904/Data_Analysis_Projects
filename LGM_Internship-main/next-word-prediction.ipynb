In his eyes she eclipses and\n","predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\n","akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\n","were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\n","was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\n","the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\n","false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\n","and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for\n","drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained\n","reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\n","adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\n","throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\n","instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\n","be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\n","yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\n","Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n","\n","I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\n","from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\n","interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\n","of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\n","while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\n","soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\n","books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\n","the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\n","nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\n","and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\n","observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\n","mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\n","From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\n","summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\n","of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\n","finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\n","successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\n","his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\n","the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\n","\n","One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a\n","journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\n","my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\n","door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\n","with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\n","keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\n","extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\n","looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\n","against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\n","head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\n","knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\n","story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\n","dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\n","and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n","\n","His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\n","to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\n","me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\n","spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\n","and looked me over\n"]}],"source":["print(read_file('1661-0.txt')[:5000])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### b.
